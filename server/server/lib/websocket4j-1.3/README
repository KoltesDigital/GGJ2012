 General information
=====================

This directory tree holds version 1.3 of GNU WebSocket4J, Java
library implementing WebSocket protocol.

GNU WebSocket4J is licensed under the terms of GNU GPLv2 (or later) with linking
exception.  There is a copy of this license in COPYING file.

See the file NEWS for information on new features and other user-visible changes
in recent versions of GNU WebSocket4J.  List of all changes (auto generated from
GNU Bazaar branch history) is available in ChangeLog file.

If you encounter bugs in this release, please report them to
https://bugs.launchpad.net/websocket4j.  Your reports will make GNU WebSocket4J
run better on various systems that it's not normally tested on.

==============
 Installation
==============

GNU WebSocket4J can be built and installed in several ways.  The default is GNU
style installation that follows GNU Coding Standards.  GNU WebSocket4J can also
be installed using system package manager for RPM and DEB based distributions.
After running the configure script you will be given a list of possible build
types (gnu possibility will always be present), you can choose different build
type than default by providing BUILD_TYPE variable to configure script (for
example ./configure BUILD_TYPE=rpm).  The next chapters cover different
installation possibilities in detail.

 GNU style installation
========================

Just standard './configure && make && make install' should configure, build and
install this package.  The file INSTALL in this directory explains all options
possible for a GNU style installation.

 DEB and RPM based installation
================================

Distribution specific installation option is meant to install the library in
standard place for jars in your distribution.  It is done by putting the jar
into a DEB or RPM package and installing it using rpm or dpkg package manager.

'./configure BUILD_TYPE=my_build_type && make' will create the packages in the
choosen format and place them in 'package' directory, 'make install' will
install this packages.  You can use 'make uninstall' later to remove this
package from your system.

WARNING: This installation type places files in the right places for your
distribution, it completely ignores several configure options like '--prefix'
and other ones specifying installation path.  Therefore it does NOT follow all
of the GNU coding standards.

 Why should I care where the jars go?
--------------------------------------

Some distributions provide utilities for working with Java libraries (like
build_classpath on RPM based distributions), but they only work if jars are
installed in the right place.
